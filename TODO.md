# Story Delete Feature Fix

## Backend Status
- [x] deleteStory function exists in storyController.js
- [x] DELETE /:id route exists in story.js

## Frontend Fixes Needed
- [ ] Add deleteStory function to frontend/src/utils/api.js
- [ ] Update Stories.jsx to use API function instead of direct axios
- [ ] Test story deletion functionality

## Testing
- [ ] Verify story deletion works from Stories page
- [ ] Check error handling for unauthorized deletions
- [ ] Confirm UI updates after deletion
